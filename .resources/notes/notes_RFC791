  INTERNET PROTOCOL

The internet protocol is specifically limited in scope to provide the functions necessary to deliver a 
package from a source to destination (datagrams). IP capitalizes on supporting network services to provide
other mechanisms for quality (reliability, flow control, sequencing ... etc).[TCP for example]

(UNDERSTAND) Where it fits in the model?
A TCP module would call on internet module to take a TCP segment (packet of data after TCP added its headers)
this would become the data portion of an internet datagram. TCP would provide the address and other parameters
as arguments to the call to internet module. Internet module would then create a datagram and call the local network
interface to transmit the internet datagram.

(REMEMBER) IP provides 2 basic functions: addressing and fragmentation

(UNDERSTAND) Address is used to determine the destination.
Routing is how it gets there (determined by the next layer in the network).

Internet modules, use fields in the IP header to fragment and reassembe datagrams when necessary.

(UNDERSTAND) reconciling independance with fragmentation:
By independance here it means that each datagram (even if fragmented) travels to a destination independently,
might even take a different route. (each fragment contains fully formed header and can travel alone)
Fragmentation mechanisms means that the header implements mechanisms to 
"put-back" those datagrams whenever its needed.

IP uses four mechanisms in providing its services:
	- Type of service: service choice provided in networks used to select transmission parameters, next network
	when routing.
	- Time to live: upper bound on the lifetime of a datagram. (self destruct timer)
	- Options: timestamps, security, special routing (unnecessary for most common communications)
	- Header Checksum: verification that header is correct,
	 note: for routing, destination ... etc not the data it self.

(UNDERSTAND) The internet protocol does not provide a reliable communication facility.
There are no acknowledgments either end-to-end or hop-by-hop.
There is no error control for data, only a header checksum.
There are no retransmissions.
There is no flow control.
